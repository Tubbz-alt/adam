Adding a new action
###################

TODO

.. Here's what I think the general outline is:
   1. In phase1_ontology:
      1. Add a new ontology type subtyping ACTION.
         1. If it involves a transfer of possession, mark it as such.
      2. Create an action description for each variation of the action.
  2. Add a lexicon entry to $LANGUAGE_phase1_lexicon for each language you want to use in your experiment
