************************
Adding a binary property
************************

TODO

.. Here's what I think the general outline is.
   1. In phase1_ontology:
      1. Add a new ontology type subtyping PERCEIVABLE_PROPERTY.
   2. Add a lexicon entry to $LANGUAGE_phase1_lexicon for each language you want to use in your experiment

Adding a color
**************

TODO

.. Here's what I think the general outline is.
Adding a color is much like adding a property with a few differences.
1. In phase1_ontology:
1. Add a new ontology type subtyping COLOR, with the added property CAN_FILL_TEMPLATE_SLOT.
2. Add an entry to COLORS_TO_RGBS mapping your color to the appropriate hex value or values.
2. Add a lexicon entry to $LANGUAGE_phase1_lexicon for each language you want to use in your experiment
